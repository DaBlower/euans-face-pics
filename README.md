# Euan's Face Pics
This is a really simple api that serves images of the one and only Euan Ripper
## Usage
The /euan/random endpoint returns a random image of Euan, and you can use it like below

`<img id="randomImg" src="https://euan.olive.hackclub.app/euan/random" width="700px" height="auto" alt="random image of euan"/>`

You can also make a request to the /euan/count endpoint to get the amount of images that this API currently has

uhh that's basically it
